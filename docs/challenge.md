## Conventions
### PR naming convention
All pull request will have a title in the form `[(Part X|Base)] <short
description>`, to document which part of the challenge the PR is addressing.

It is possible that a single pull request modifies code related to different
parts of the challenge, in which case there I will use a comma separated list
between squeare brackets.

**Examples**: `[Part IV] Configure CI`, `[Part II, Part
III] Update API and deployment method`, `[Base] Document API`
